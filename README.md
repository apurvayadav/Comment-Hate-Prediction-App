# Comment-Hate-Prediction-App
* This App assigns percentage of different type of hate in the viz toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate. 
* This provides an insight on the sentiment of the comment.
* This app could be used to flag hateful comments on social media. It can also be used to filter out comments.

# Methodology
* To create this app. I took the data from kaggle competition on [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge).
* Applied preprocessing and used LSTM to predict the different probabilities of the output labels.
* Deployed the app on HuggingFace Spaces using Gradio. Streamlit can also be used.

# Notebook
